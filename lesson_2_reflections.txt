What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


	
	Now that you’ve initialized your first repository, go

	and your thoughts on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Now that you’ve added a file to the staging area 
	(or maybe multiple files!), go add the following 
	question and your thoughts on it to your 
	lesson_2_reflections file:

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Now that you’ve committed changes using the

	following question and your thoughts on it to your 
	reflections file:

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	Now that you’ve learned how to use Git to merge branches 
	together, go add the following question and your thoughts
	on it to your reflections file:

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	Now that you’ve learned when Git will not 
	be able to automatically merge branches, and 
	what happens when it can’t, go add the following 
	question and your thoughts on it to your
